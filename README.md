### About me

I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer that loves beer, currently living in Lisbon, Portugal.
- I'm currently working at OLX Group, remote from Lisbon, Portugal;
- I have also experience in some domais, mainly Logistics, Financial and now Classifieds :) 
- I have a Bachelor degree in Information Systems ([INF/UFG](https://http://inf.ufg.br/), Brazil)
- I'm more experienced developing applications using Java in versions 8 and 11, but currently, I'm working with Kotlin, which has been a great experience and everyday I love more this programing language;
- I'm also experienced working with .Net platform and Angular 8+ and ReacJS for front-end applications;
- I'm excited about learning about software architecture, mainly those modular and event based ones;
